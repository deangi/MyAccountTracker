  <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    MyAccountTracker does not collect, store, or share any personal
    information. The application has no backend server, no database, and no
    analytics or tracking of any kind.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Data Stays With You</h2>
  <p>
    All financial data you enter is stored exclusively in your own Google Sheets
    spreadsheet, in your own Google account. MyAccountTracker reads and writes
    to that spreadsheet on your behalf using your Google credentials. At no point
    does any data pass through or reside on servers operated by the developers
    of this application.
  </p>

  <h2>Google Account Access</h2>
  <p>
    MyAccountTracker requests permission to access Google Sheets and Google Drive
    solely to read and write your spreadsheet. These permissions are granted
    through Google's standard OAuth 2.0 flow. Your Google credentials are never
    seen or stored by this application.
  </p>

  <h2>No Cookies or Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    MyAccountTracker does not use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or any other
    tracking technology. No usage data, session data, or analytics are collected.
  </p>

  <h2>No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Because no personal information is collected, there is nothing to share with
    third parties. MyAccountTracker does not sell, rent, or disclose any user
    data to anyone.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue in the
    project repository.
